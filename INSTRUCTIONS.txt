LAB 04 - Instructions

OBJECTIVE:
  Demonstrate your knowledge of Mongoose and Models by fixing the bugs

STEPS:
  1) Repair the following 5 issues
    a) Can't run the application due to this error:
       "Error: Cannot find module 'express'"
       Fix it so there are no missing libraries
    b) Can't see the form in the "new" view:
       - /superheroes/new
       Fix it so we can see the form
    c) When editing a superhero it always creates a new one.
       Fix it so it updates the selected hero.
    d) The "index" view won't load with the list of
       superheroes:
       - /superheroes
       Fix it so we can see the list of registered
       heroes. (Also, create at least 4)
    e) The created at timestamp is missing from hero
       documents when a new hero is created:
       Fix the model so the created at timestamp
       is auto-created when we save a new hero
  2) Push all code to Github
  3) Deploy your application to Heroku
     - Don't forget to add your environment variables
